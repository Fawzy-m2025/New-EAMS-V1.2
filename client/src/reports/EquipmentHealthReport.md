## Technical Implementation Details

### Calculation Methods
- **Failure Probability:** ISO 14224-based risk factors with normalized indices (0-10 scale)
- **Reliability:** Combined static (70%) and Weibull time-dependent (30%) analysis
- **Dependencies:** Applied for Severe/Critical failures using dependency matrix
- **Validation:** VibrationData bounds checking, availability validation

### Risk Factor Coefficients (ISO 14224)
- **Critical:** 1.5-4% (0.015 + 0.0025 × normalizedIndex)
- **Severe:** 0.8-2.5% (0.008 + 0.0017 × normalizedIndex)  
- **Moderate:** 0.4-1.5% (0.004 + 0.0011 × normalizedIndex)
- **Good:** 0-0.8% (0.0008 × normalizedIndex)

### Dependency Factors
- **Misalignment → Bearing Defects:** 1.2×
- **Misalignment → Mechanical Looseness:** 1.1×
- **Cavitation → Bearing Defects:** 1.15×
- **Unbalance → Bearing Defects:** 1.1×

### Weibull Analysis (30-day evaluation)
- **Formula:** R(t) = e^(-(t/η)^β)
- **Time Period:** t = 720 hours (30 days)
- **Combined Reliability:** 0.7 × R_static + 0.3 × R_weibull

### Validation Criteria
- **Availability:** 0-100%, not NaN
- **Indices:** Non-negative values
- **VibrationData:** VH,VV,VA,AH,AV,AA,f,N ≥ 0, N < 100,000, f < 1,000
- **Probability Caps:** 40% (with availability), 25% (fallback)

### Standards Compliance
- **ISO 14224:** Reliability data collection and analysis for oil and gas equipment
- **ISO 13374:** Condition monitoring and diagnostics of machines
- **Centrifugal Pumps:** Specific calibration for rotating machinery applications
