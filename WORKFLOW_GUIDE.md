# Insight Hub (EAMS) â€“ Advanced User Workflow Guide

---

## Introduction

Welcome to the Insight Hub (EAMS) Workflow Guide. This document provides a step-by-step, user-friendly walkthrough of all major workflows in the platform, designed for both new and advanced users. It covers Asset Management, Maintenance Management, Condition Monitoring, Financial Management, and Analytics, referencing the platform's advanced features, UI/UX, and best practices.

## Data Handling & Cross-Module Integration

Insight Hub (EAMS) is designed for seamless data flow and integration across all modules, similar to leading SAP, CMMS, and ERP systems. Every data entry, update, or action in one module is reflected in real time across analytics, dashboards, and related modules, ensuring unified business intelligence and operational efficiency.

### How Data Flows Across the Platform

- **Asset Management:**
  - Adding or editing an asset updates the asset registry, which is immediately available for maintenance scheduling, condition monitoring, and financial calculations (depreciation, ROI).
  - Asset status, location, and specifications are referenced in work orders, condition logs, and analytics.

- **Condition Monitoring:**
  - New vibration, thermal, or oil readings are logged and linked to the relevant asset.
  - Alerts and health scores are generated and reflected in both the asset's details and the maintenance planning module.
  - Predictive analytics use historical and real-time data to trigger maintenance or financial impact analysis.

- **Maintenance Management:**
  - Creating or updating a work order references the asset registry and condition data.
  - Completion of work orders updates asset history, triggers cost calculations, and may reset or update condition monitoring KPIs.
  - Work order analytics feed into financial reports and unified dashboards.

- **Financial Management:**
  - Depreciation, budgeting, and cost analysis use real-time asset and maintenance data.
  - Maintenance costs, asset utilization, and condition-driven events (e.g., failures) are reflected in financial KPIs and reports.

- **Analytics & Dashboards:**
  - All modules feed data into unified dashboards, enabling cross-module insights (e.g., how asset health impacts maintenance cost and ROI).
  - Real-time updates ensure that any change in one module is instantly visible in analytics and reports.

### Example: Unified Data Flow

1. **A technician enters a new vibration reading for Pump A1.**
   - The reading is logged in Condition Monitoring and linked to Pump A1 in the Asset Registry.
   - If the reading exceeds thresholds, an alert is generated and shown in both the Condition Monitoring and Asset Management modules.
   - Predictive analytics may recommend a new maintenance work order, which is created in Maintenance Management and linked to Pump A1.
   - The work order, once completed, updates Pump A1's maintenance history and is reflected in financial cost analysis and depreciation schedules.
   - All these changes are immediately visible in the unified analytics dashboard, showing the impact on OEE, MTBF, cost, and risk.

### Best Practices for Data Consistency & Business Intelligence

- **Always use the platform's forms and workflows** for data entry to ensure all dependencies and analytics are updated.
- **Leverage real-time notifications and alerts** to stay informed of cross-module impacts.
- **Use unified dashboards** to monitor the health, cost, and performance of assets and operations.
- **Export and share reports** for compliance, audits, and decision-making.
- **Integrate with external systems (SAP, ERP, CMMS)** via API endpoints (future-ready architecture).
